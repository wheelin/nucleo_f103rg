# Nucleo F103RG board support package written in Rust

This repo contains code for a learning project. It isn't a full blown generic hardware abstraction layer and it may
certainly contain aweful contructs and wrong patterns. Please, open an issue if you have some useful advices to tell me.

## Goals
The repo's goal is to cover most of the functionalities of the microcontroller as a learning project for Rustlang.
